  <summary>🛠️ <strong>Other Ideas & Concepts</strong></summary>

- Tekken Ball Mini Game Bot (Turn-Based in Text)
  Players take turns typing !serve, !hit, !smash, etc.
  
  Bot calculates ball trajectory and damage.
  Tracks HP like a mini-RPG (each ball hit does damage).
  Could have randomness (critical smash!, ball whiffed!)

  Example:
  @Player1 uses !hit, ball speed is 80!
  @Player2 tries to !return… Miss! Takes 12 HP damage!
  
  Could expand into 2v2, special moves, ball types


- [**Tekken Ball Trivia**](https://slawsimulation.github.io/Tekken-Ball-Trivia/)
  Posts trivia questions like:
  "Which game introduced Tekken Ball first?"
  "True or False: You can KO your opponent with the ball alone."

- **“How Tekken Ball Are You?” Quiz**
  Host a silly quiz on GitHub Pages or Discord:
  “Do you like chaos?”
  “Are you a masher?”
  “Do you fear projectiles?”
  Result: “You are 73% Tekken Ball.”
  
- **Tekken Ball Leaderboard**
  Players use !ballwin or !ballloss to log results.
  Keeps a public scoreboard for most wins, streaks, etc.
  Could integrate ELO rating later if wanted.

  
- **Tekken Ball Stat Tracker**
  Web form to log matches: who won, score, characters used.
  Displays stats like:
  Most used characters
  Average win rate
  Longest win streak

  
- **Tekken Ball Rebound Simulator**
  Visual tool that shows how ball speed affects bounce/trajectory.
  Use basic JS canvas or p5.js.
  Could be pure educational or meme physics fun.


- **Tekken Ball Fan Wiki**
  GitHub Pages site with:
  Rules for Tekken Ball
  Tier list of who’s best in Ball mode
  Strategy guide: "Best characters for ball damage"


- **Tekken Ball Damage Calculator**
  Input: Character, Move, Ball Speed
  Output: Estimated damage dealt to opponent
  Based on simplified rules, multipliers, and ball impact values.


- **Tekken Ball Challenge Generator**
  Randomly creates a fun or ridiculous Ball Mode challenge.

  **Example output:**
  “Use only lows and side-steps.”
  “You must taunt before each hit.”
  “Each round you win, change characters.”


- **"Tekken Ball Replays as ASCII"**
  Store simple Tekken Ball match data and output replays in ASCII format.


- **Tekken Ball Coaching Bot**
  You DM it your character, who you’re playing against, and it gives tips:
  “Against Paul, stay low and smash when he charges.”
  Could be a static rule-based system or fake GPT-style advice bot.


- **Tekken Ball Emoji Reactions Bot**
  Discord bot that reacts with random emojis whenever someone mentions:
  ball, smash, serve, etc.
  Could react with 🔴, 💥, 🤯, 🏓, etc.
  Easy to build and fun for chaotic chats.


-  **Tekken Ball Combo Generator**
  You input a character, it gives a randomized combo ending in a ball hit.
  e.g., “df1 → 1 → 3+4 → ball spike”
  Could be silly or functional.

  
- **"Ball Character Weakness Analyzer"**
  Web app where you select a character and it shows:
  “Weak to: fast projectiles, low launchers”
  “Ball mode tip: struggles with wall bounce recovery”
  Could be community-voted via GitHub issues or markdown.
